# MasterlockBreaker

**How to use:**

1. Make sure you have the latest version of python installed. ([Intructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/))
2. Download the .zip file and extratct it.
3. Open the extracted folder.
4. Double-click the .py file.
5. Enter the third number of you lock combination when prompted.
You should now see 100 possible lock combinations. It will take a while but try each one. Remeber that trying 100 combinations is a lot easier than 64000.

Please note this only works for Masterlocks. Locks with a model number starting in 800 and 908 usually don't work.

**How to find the third number in your combination:**

(Go here if you have a problem or you want more in-depth instructions.)

**Step 1: Clear the lock:**
  Rotate the dial, at minimum, three times past the zero mark in the clockwise (right) direction. Additionally, be sure to stop the rotation at the zero mark.

**Step 2: Place tension on the shackle:**
  
  Begin by applying a tense pulling force on the shackle of the padlock. While maintaining this upward pressure on the shackle, begin to rotate the dial slowly in the counterclockwise (left) direction.

**Step 3: Finding the first sticking point:** 
  
  While rotating the dial of the lock in the counterclockwise direction, you will shortly come to a point where it will jam and no longer allow you to freely rotate it. You should be able to turn the dial slightly in the clockwise (right) direction and back again while still holding pressure on the shackle. This is our first “sticking range.” Write down both stopping points in this rut. For example, the counterclockwise (left) stopping point could be 8, while the clockwise (right) stopping point could be 6. In this example, our sticking range would be 6 to 8. Next, we have to find the "sticking point." This is done by simply taking the middle number of our sticking range. In our example, this would be 7. Be aware when finding your sticking range that the dial can also stop between numbers or, that is, halfway. An example of this would be when turning the dial in the counterclockwise direction to find your stopping point and it instead stops between 8 and 9. Your counterclockwise stopping point would then be 8.5. In addition, when you rotate the dial in the clockwise position, it stops between 6 and 7 giving you a stopping point of 6.5. The resulting sticking range would be 6.5 to 8.5 and our sticking point would be 7.5.

**Step 4: Finding the second sticking point:** 
  
  Release the upward tension on the shackle and rotate the dial counterclockwise until you are just past the higher number of your last sticking range. For example, if your previous sticking range was 6 to 8, rotate the dial to 9. Next, reapply the upward tension on the shackle and just as before, turn the dial in the counterclockwise direction until it once again jams. Take note of this counterclockwise stopping point and, with tension still applied, rotate the dial clockwise until it stops once more, giving you your clockwise stopping point. Once again, record the sticking range and determine the middle number to find the sticking point.
  
**Step 5: Finding the remaining sticking points:**
  
  We now have 2 of the 12 sticking points we need to crack the third number of our combination. Repeat the following steps of rotating the dial in the counterclockwise direction and finding the sticking points until you have 12 numbers recorded.
  
**Step 6: Cracking the third number:** 
  
  If you take a look at the sticking points you have recorded, you might notice that there are seven fractions and five whole numbers. Cross out all of the fractions leaving only the five whole numbers. If you did the steps above correctly you will notice that all of your remaining numbers end with the same digit, except for one. This oddball is our lucky winner as it is the third number in our combination.
